    so this splits into 4 entries. If this isn't applicable everywhere we
    need to revisit this logic

    It is better if we feed the input into this function as a string instead of
    a file descriptor because that means we have more control over our file
    descriptor in the program we are calling this function from. Otherwise we
    would have to introduce logic in here to perform actions on the file descriptor
    correctly which would not be good.
